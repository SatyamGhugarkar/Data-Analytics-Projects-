📊 Website Data Analysis using Python

This project focuses on analyzing website traffic data using Python. It explores user behavior, traffic trends, and key metrics using pandas, matplotlib, and other data analysis tools. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw website data and visualize them effectively.

🚀 Project Overview

The project performs end-to-end data analysis on exported website data, including:

Cleaning and preprocessing dataset

Understanding website traffic patterns

Analyzing user activity trends

Visualizing key metrics

Generating insights for decision-making

The analysis is implemented through a Jupyter Notebook and a Python script, making it simple and modular.
